## About:

* name: magic-word
    * function: password program

This is a program inspired by the movie Jurassic Park. Specifically, the [scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg) where hacker Dennis Nedry places a password protected program on his machine to prevent users form accessing the main security grid of Jurassic Park.

Nedry was the first hacker I came in contact with as a child. And, from that point on I became interested in programming and computers. Thanks to [Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFYk6k_XGEU) for the inspiration.

## Run:
