## Ah, ah, ah...you didn't say the magic word!

### About:

Executable: magic-word

This is a program inspired by the movie Jurassic Park. Specifically, the scenewhere hacker Dennis Nedry places a password protected program on his machine to prevent users form accessing the main security grid of Jurassic Park (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg). Nedry was the first hacker I came in contact with as a child. And, from that point on I became interested inprogramming and computers. I hope some of you can modify my code and implement it within your own password protected programs. Thank you Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg for your inspiration.
