## Ah, ah, ah...you didn't say the magic word!

### About:

name: magic-word
function: password program

This is a program inspired by the movie Jurassic Park. Specifically, the scene where hacker Dennis Nedry places a password protected program on his machine to prevent users form accessing the main security grid of Jurassic Park (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg).

 Nedry was the first hacker I came in contact with as a child. And, from that point on I became interested in programming and computers. I hope some of you can modify my code and implement it within your own password protected programs. Thank you Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg for your inspiration.
